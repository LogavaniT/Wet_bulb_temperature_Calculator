    India is currently experiencing severe heat waves, especially in the parts of coastal cities. So, have you ever walked outside on a summer day and immediately felt like you were being suffocated by the heat? Or perhaps you've heard the term "wet bulb temperature" being thrown around during a heatwave. In either case, understanding wet bulb temperature and its implications is crucial for staying safe and healthy in hot weather.

    Wet bulb temperature is a crucial factor in determining how hot it is outside and how our bodies respond to the heat. It is essential to pay attention to this measure and take necessary precautions during hot weather to avoid heat-related illnesses.

    st.markdown("""
    Wet bulb temperature is a meteorological term used to describe the lowest temperature that can be reached by evaporating water into the air at constant pressure. It is measured by covering a thermometer bulb with a wet cloth and letting the water evaporate. As the water evaporates, it cools the thermometer, showing the wet bulb temperature. This temperature helps measure humidity and understand how much water can evaporate into the air, affecting things like comfort, farming, and weather patterns.

    Although many equations have been created over the years, our calculator uses the Stull formula, which is accurate for relative humidities between 5% and 99% and temperatures between -20¬∞C and 50¬∞C. The wet-bulb calculator is based on the following formula:

    ùëáùë§ = ùëá arctan(0.151977 * (ùëÖùêª + 8.313659)**0.5) + 0.00391838 * (ùëÖùêª)**1.5 arctan(0.023101 * ùëÖùêª) ‚àí arctan(ùëÖùêª ‚àí 1.676331) + arctan(ùëá + ùëÖùêª) ‚àí 4.686035**

    - **ùëá** ‚Äî Temperature ‚Äî air temperature or dry-bulb temperature is the temperature given by a thermometer not exposed to direct sunlight.
    - **ùëÖùêª[%]** ‚Äî Relative humidity ‚Äî a ratio of how much water vapor is in the air to how much it could contain at a given temperature.
    
    **Note:** Both temperature and wet bulb temperature in this formula are expressed in ¬∞C! If you would like to use other units, you need to convert them to the Celsius scale before you start calculations.

    The wet-bulb temperature might not be a widely known measure, but it has some valuable functions:

    - **Construction:** Different materials react differently to different humidities, so this temperature is needed when designing a building in different climates.
    - **Snowmaking:** Snow production needs low temperatures, and when the humidity decreases, the temperature rises.
    - **Meteorology:** Forecasters use wet-bulb temperature to predict rain, snow, or freezing rain.
